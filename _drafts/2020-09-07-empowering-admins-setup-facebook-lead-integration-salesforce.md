Today we are showing you a cool trick that you definitely want to take advantage of [now that you have made a start with your marketing strategy](https://aocollab.tech/2021-08-31-small-businesses-communication-basics/). It involves **Facebook** and your **Salesforce Sales Cloud**.

**Facebook Lead Ads** is a witty solution that makes filling forms quick on easy on mobile. It leverages the data pool of *1.7 billion people* already present on Facebook to pre-populate relevant fields, the forms are optimised for small screens, and the leads are generally higher-quality thanks to the audience selection and optimisation already present on the ads.

> HOT TIP: If you're also a Marketing Cloud customer, ensure the sales process is in sync with all other customer messaging across channels like email, mobile, social with Journey Builder and manage your Facebook audiences with Advertising Studio.

## Integration Requirements
* Salesforce Edition" Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, Performance
* A Facebook for business account to link
* Lightning ready
* Native app
<br/>
<br/>

## Alternatives: Zapier and Automate.io
In case you already make use of workflows to automate processes and connect third party apps, here are a couple of options that allow you to connect **Salesforce** and **Facebook Lead Ads**:
* [Integrate with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/facebook-lead-ads/integrations/salesforce)
* [Integrate with Automate.io](https://automate.io/integration/facebook-lead-ads/salesforce)

The advantage of creating workflows with these platforms - especially if you already have in-house automation specialists - is the freedom to create custom workflows that make sense for your organization.
The other side of the coin is the inability to leverage an out-of-the-box integration or get support for it, so we recommend this solution to companies who already well versed in Zapier or Automate.io and have the capacity to have one of the team build and maintain the automation.
