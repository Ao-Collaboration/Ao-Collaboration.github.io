Navigating automation and all its possibilities can be a tough challenge, especially using a comprehensive platform such as **Salesforce**. With this article, we attempt to give you enough clarity to either have a go at trying automations for your org, or at least get some good grounding on what you would like and how you would like it implemented by specialists like us.

The first point of order is a reminder of why automation is a good idea. It frees your time (and your team's time) up to focus on more meaningful tasks, and it ensures that the process you want in place is always followed 100% of the time.

The second most important piece of information you need to know right away is that **Salesforce** tools do not need you to write code - meaning both the learning curve and the readability of the processes built are very friendly.

## What kind of automation is the right one for me?
Now, to the interesting part. The beauty and the bane of **Salesforce** is that there is a solution for everything that is relevant to your particular business, you only have to put some work into forging it.

Automation is so paramount in today's world that **Salesforce** has made it available for **all** editions, with some differences:
* Processes and flows are available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions
* Approvals and Workflow are available in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions

So here are your automation building blocks:
* Approvals
* Process Builder
* Flow Builder
* Workflow

A couple of key differences between processes and flows:
* *Processes run in the background* — you just see the results when they are finished
* *Flows are interactive* — they can request input from the user and branch to a different action depending on that input

* *Processes are triggered by an event* like a record being created or updated
* *Flows are triggered by the user* doing things like clicking on a button or a link

**Salesforce** wants you to succeed, which is why they give you a [super detailed breakdown of all the feats and actions](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.process_which_tool.htm&type=5) you can take depending on what tool you are using and what is the purpose of your automation.

## Flow Solutions: a dedicated category on Appexchange
Another powerful solution that **Salesforce** has made available to all its clients is the [**Flow Solutions** category on their **Appexchange**](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxStore?type=Flow).

They are partner-built integrations designed to simplify the flow building process by making it easier to create flows that connect with and perform actions on third-party systems without requiring additional integration or code.
