Small businesses typically start off by concentrating their efforts on operations. Once all the gremlins have been all ironed out, there is a little more room to expand their focus both in terms of capacity and possibly in terms of budget.

New Zealand small businesses are even more *compact* than the rest of the world: in the US, small businesses are establishments that employ less than 500 employees, while a kiwi small business counts less than 20 employees [according to the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/business/support-for-business/small-business/)

With well over 90% of businesses being considered small, and over 70% of them having no employees at all, implementing a successful marketing strategy is both a necessity and a challenge. We advocate adopting a CRM - and we recommend **Salesforce** while we are at it - from the very beginning to ensure consistency with your business operations, customer service, sales, and marketing. 

With the right tools and processes you will be able to expand your lead and customer bases, securing the future of your enterprise and helping your business grow. All your efforts will help you learn how to best reach potential customers and promote your products and/or services.
