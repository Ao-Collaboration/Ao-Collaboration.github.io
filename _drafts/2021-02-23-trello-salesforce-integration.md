The integration between **Trello** and **Salesforce** might be a limited one, however it's important to mention especially for the benefit of those who - like many New Zealand small businesses - need to find the right balance with platform usage and costs.

**Salesforce**, as you may expect, is the platform we recommend you invest your dollars on from the start. [From Essentials to the massive Pardot Growth](https://www.salesforce.com/au/editions-pricing/small-business/) you can get the most out of it, and once you're on the platform you don't need to worry about scaling up. But you already knew that, didn't you?

**Trello** is a great collaboration tool for businesses that need to watch that bottom line closely, but still want to keep organized. They describe themselves really well:
> Trelloâ€™s boards, lists, and cards enable teams to organize and prioritize projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way.

Most importantly, you have very high chances to be able to stay on the **Free** plan until your business has expanded enough to sustain the cost (the next tier up is 12.50USD monthly per user, which is still pretty sweet). With the **Free** plan you still get to use 10 boards and you have 1 Power-Up per board available.
