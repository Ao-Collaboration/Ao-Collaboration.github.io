Ao Collaboration (Ao Collab) exists to help the emerging and small Salesforce business sector, who may not have the funds or the need for the work that the larger Salesforce Partners look after.
We are the friendly personal connection to help get Salesforce working for them.

## the name

**Ao** is the Maori word for cloud, to dawn and world.

Collaboration is what we do with other businesses. We collaborate with them to help improve their use and adoption of the Salesforce system.

Together Ao Collaboration means "To Collaborate over the Cloud", "A dawn of a new collobration", "Global Collaborations". When said aloud it sounds like "Our" Collaboration.
