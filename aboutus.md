## the name

**Ao** is the Maori word for cloud, to dawn and world.

Collaboration is what we do with other businesses. We collaborate with them to help improve their use and adoption of the Salesforce system.

Together Ao Collaboration means "To Collaborate over the Cloud", "A dawn of a new collobration", "Global Collaborations". When said aloud it sounds like "Our" Collaboration.
