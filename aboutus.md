Ao Collaboration (Ao Collab) exists to help the emerging and small Salesforce business sector, who may not have the funds or the need for the work that the larger Salesforce Partners look after.
We are the friendly personal connection to help get Salesforce working for them.

We're helping mentor other people, parents in particular who are trying to find work that is flexible around school hours and who want to learn new skills in the Salesforce sphere.
Ao Collab is creating a network of like minded people who can help remotely in this area.

## the name

**Ao** is the Maori word for cloud, to dawn and world.

Collaboration is what we do with other businesses. We collaborate with them to help improve their use and adoption of the Salesforce system.

Together Ao Collaboration means "To Collaborate over the Cloud", "A dawn of a new collobration", "Global Collaborations". When said aloud it sounds like "Our" Collaboration.
