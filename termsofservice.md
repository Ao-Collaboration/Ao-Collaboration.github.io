*	Ao Collaboration does not currently offer escalation options
The Client can access Post-Launch Support in two different ways:

### 5.1	Active Client

* Adding a new project makes the Client Active, gaining access to the fastest turnaround
*	Post-Launch Support for Active Clients will be billed at the end of each month, at the hourly rate of $82,50 +GST. Time will be measured in increments of 15 minutes

### 5.2	Support Retainer

*	Where no further projects are planned, the Client can opt in for a Support Retainer, starting from a minimum of $165 + GST per month for 2 hours of support
*	Support Retainer packages are to be paid at the beginning of the month, and are valid until the end of that month
*	Support Retainer packages do not carry over unused hours
*	Support Retainer packages can be updated at given moment, as long as the Client gives a minimum of 5 business daysâ€™ notice before the following billing cycle

### 5.3	Inactive Client

*	A Client not choosing either of the above options after the end of the In-Scope Support will be flagged as Inactive
*	Inactive Clients will not get access to the fastest turnaround, meaning that Active Clients and Clients with Support Retainers will have priority over them
*	Inactive Clients will be billed at the end of each month, at the casual hourly rate of $110 + GST. Time will be measured in increments of 15 minutes and it will include any admin related to the request
*	An Inactive Client can choose to opt in for a Support Retainer at any moment, the Support Retainer will kick in with a 4-weeks delay

## 6.0	Billing

*	Any changes to project costs will be discussed with the Client and documented
*	A final cost estimate will be provided at the end of the scoping phase
*	The Client will be charged a Scoping Fee of $165 + GST whenever a project does not go past the scoping phase
*	The final cost estimate will include a Project Contingency. The Project Contingency will be 30% of the total cost of the project and will be pre-approved by the Client upon approval of the project
*	The Project Contingency will not be used until Ao Collaboration has notified the Client that the project budget has reached the Contingency area
*	All projects will need a 40% Deposit at the beginning of the job, and the rest will be billed at project launch
*	Particularly big or complex projects that require an Agile approach will require for Ao Collaboration and the Client to agree on a preferred payment plan prior to the start of the project (i.e. instalments, hourly rate)
