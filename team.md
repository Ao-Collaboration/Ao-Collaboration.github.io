{% capture kate_content %}
Kate has been in the Salesforce Eco-System for the past 6 years and also has 10+ years of customer service experience across many different sectors.
<br/><br/>
She started with Salesforce as an in-house admin, then studying and freelancing as an Admin & Consultant. Kate then went on to form Ao Collaboration in a desire to help the SMB sector in making sure that Salesforce is working with their businesses processes. She found that too often SMBs were left to the side in pursuit of larger projects and, with a passion to help, wanted to create a space that could listen and serve our smaller clients needs.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work, Kate loves spending time with her family, and encouraging her kids on their individual paths. Thanks to the Lockdowns of 2020, indoor plants and Animal Crossing have also become fixtures in her life.

{% capture serena_content %}
Serena comes from 15+ years of customer experience across many different sectors, including SaaS and web agencies.
<br/><br/>
Here at Ao Collaboration, she is invested in helping improving processes and operations, as well as offering client solutions to suit their specific needs.
<br/><br/>
When not at work, Serena can be found initiating novices to the fine art of playing Dungeons and Dragons, cooking food and pairing it with wine, and lecturing people on what ingredients do and do not go on pizza.

{% capture ben_content %}
Ben has a broad knowledge base due to his experience in multiple different industries, being education, technology, retail, event planning, medical devices, as well as being a good dump for useless trivia information.
<br/><br/>
He comes with 5 years experience in the Salesforce Eco System, starting out as an in house admin and tech support. He has now decided to further this and is currently studying for his Developer Certification.
<br/><br/>
Something that applies both to work and outside of it is that he loves to help people and believes that a collaborative effort will make tasks go more smoothly and achieve better results.
<br/><br/>
He is a typical Kiwi bloke who likes to cook and does a really good steak and experiments with different food combinations which shouldn't work but do, just like him!
