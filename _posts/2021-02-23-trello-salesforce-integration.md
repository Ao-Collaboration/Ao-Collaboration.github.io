The integration between **Trello** and **Salesforce** might be a limited one, however it's important to mention especially for the benefit of those who - like many New Zealand small businesses - need to find the right balance with platform usage and costs.

**Salesforce**, as you may expect, is the platform we recommend you invest your dollars on from the start. [From Essentials to the massive Pardot Growth](https://www.salesforce.com/au/editions-pricing/small-business/) you can get the most out of it, and once you're on the platform you don't need to worry about scaling up. But you already knew that, didn't you?

**Trello** is a great collaboration tool for businesses that need to watch that bottom line closely, but still want to keep organized. They describe themselves really well:
> Trello’s boards, lists, and cards enable teams to organize and prioritize projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way.

Most importantly, you have very high chances to be able to stay on the **Free** plan until your business has expanded enough to sustain the cost (the next tier up is 12.50USD monthly per user, which is still pretty sweet). With the **Free** plan you still get to use 10 boards and you have 1 Power-Up per board available.

## Integration Requirements
* Trello requirements will depend on how many Power-Ups you already have active, your boards, and how thorough you want this integration to be
* Salesforce requirements: Professional and up (if you use Salesforce Professional, you need the API Access add-on)

**Please Note** For now, this integration is only one-way—information from Salesforce will be published in Trello, but not the other way around.

## Alternatives: Zapier and Automate.io
In case you already make use of workflows to automate processes and connect third party apps, here are a couple of options that allow you to connect **Salesforce** and **Trello**:
* [Integrate with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/integrations/trello)
* [Integrate with Automate.io](https://automate.io/integration/salesforce/trello)

The advantage of creating workflows with these platforms - especially if you already have in-house automation specialists - is the freedom to create custom workflows that make sense for your organization. The other side of the coin is the inability to leverage an out-of-the-box integration or get support for it, so we recommend this solution to companies who already well versed in Zapier or Automate.io and have the capacity to have one of the team build and maintain the automation.
