With Salesforce being one of Slack's earliest partners, a full integration was always in the cards. As their shared customer base grew with the two companies, the demand for a full collaboration brought Slack to release the well known [Salesforce for Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AKGPGUFP1-salesforce) and its Salesforce sister [Slack Integration with AppExchange](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/small-business-solutions/integrations/slack-crm-integration/).

That's right. Two apps. Each app provides different functionalities.

It integrates both with **Sales Cloud** and **Service Cloud** and it focuses on the following:
* helping the team staying in the know with custom notifications
* keeping the team on track by allowing them to search an preview records in Slack
* extending collaboration between sales and service teams
<br/>
<br/>

## Integration Requirements
Whilst both apps are supplied for Free on the **Slack app directory** and the **Salesforce appexchange**, you do need to meet certain requirements when it comes down to the version of Slack and Salesforce.

* [Slack requirements](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/pricing) will depend on how many integrations you already have with other apps, but you can do it with the Free version
* Salesforce requirements: Professional and up (**if you use Salesforce Professional, you need the API Access add-on**)
* Lightning ready
* Apps, tabs, and objects in this package do not count against org limits in Salesforce

This KnowledgeBase article will give you the step-by-step installation guide [Salesforce and Slack: Unlocking collaboration for sales and service](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/blog/collaboration/salesforce-and-slack-for-sales-and-service).

## Alternatives: Zapier and Automate.io
In case you already make use of workflows to automate processes and connect third party apps, here are a couple of options that allow you to connect **Salesforce** and **Slack**:
* [Integrate with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/integrations/slack)
* [Integrate with Automate.io](https://automate.io/integration/salesforce/slack)
The advantage of creating workflows with these platforms - especially if you already have in-house automation specialists - is the freedom to create custom workflows that make sense for your organization.
The other side of the coin is the inability to leverage an out-of-the-box integration or get support for it, so we recommend this solution to companies who already well versed in Zapier or Automate.io and have the capacity to have one of the team build and maintain the automation.
