Integrating your email and calendar activity with your CRM seems a no brainer, which is why **Salesforce** and **Google Workspace** together is such a good idea!
We know that especially for small businesses (such as our clients) **Google Workspace** provides an [affordable and comprehensive solution](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_nz/pricing.html) that includes all the Google most famous: Gmail, Drive, Meet, Calendar, Chat, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms - all the way to the less known tools such as Keep, Sites, and Currents.
Everything cloud based, seamless syncing, and the intuitive UX/UI that we all know and love.

Whilst our base recommendation is to always carefully choose the right type of integrations and extesions - something that can get challenging with Google when considering things like privacy and security - we can take a deep breath and relax when it comes to the *integration* with **Salesforce**.

Another very positive aspect of this integration is how far it can go depending on what edition of **Salesforcer** you are using and the different products of the **Google** portfolio. From a simple Gmail + Essentials to a more complex Google Analytics + Marketing Cloud, they have you covered.

<br/>

## Native Integrations
* [**Lightning for Gmail**](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/gmail_integration) - bring your Salesforce contacts, accounts, records, and opportunities into your email and calendar. Update existing and create new Salesforce records without toggling between applications
* [**Google Drive for Files Connect**](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.admin_files_connect_enable.htm&type=5) - you can attach Google Drive files to Salesforce records, processes, and Chatter posts
* [**Data Connector for Salesforce**](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/data_connector_for_salesforce/857627895310) - manage CRM data using bi-directional sync capabilities between Salesforce and Google Sheets
<br/>
<br/>

## Alternatives: Zapier and Automate.io
In case you already make use of workflows to automate processes and connect third party apps, here are a couple of options that allow you to connect **Salesforce** and **Gmail**:
* [Integrate with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/gmail/integrations/salesforce)
* [Integrate with Automate.io](https://automate.io/integration/gmail/salesforce)

The advantage of creating workflows with these platforms - especially if you already have in-house automation specialists - is the freedom to create custom workflows that make sense for your organization. The other side of the coin is the inability to leverage an out-of-the-box integration or get support for it, so we recommend this solution to companies who already well versed in Zapier or Automate.io and have the capacity to have one of the team build and maintain the automation.
