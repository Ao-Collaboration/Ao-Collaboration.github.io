With this year's Matariki we've sat down and revamped our [services and prices](/pricing/), starting this new year with renewed intent and a clearer path for our company.

On a more personal level, at Ao Collaboration we are also on a journey of learning about te ao Māori, tikanga, and te reo Māori. Learning and connecting with my heritage has become increasingly important to me and this time of year has got us asking what Matariki is, and more importantly what it means to us.

This year is particularly poignant, in the last months we have unfortunately lost two very important people in our family. Whilst it is a time of sadness, aroha and remembrance it has also been a time of gathering. Our families have come together to celebrate their lives, their passing and in doing so it has coincided with the rising of Matariki.

This past weekend we celebrated the life of a loved one passed, and also celebrated the birthday of one of our tamariki.

Although this year's gatherings were unintentional, I hope to be able to start new traditions of gatherings in the coming years for Matariki. Allowing for us to gather, to remember the past year and to look forward to the new one.

Regardless, it has been a wonderful weekend of gatherings.
