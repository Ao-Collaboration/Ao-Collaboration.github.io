While *Sales Cloud* and *Service Cloud* are usually the ones under the spotlight whenever we talk about **Salesforce** first steps, it's important to mention the third big player of the team: **Marketing Cloud**.

## What is the Marketing Cloud?

It's a cloud based platorm that operates in the area of marketing automation and customer engagement. There are different tools to choose from, plus another vast selection of add-on components, to make the platform work for your company's specific needs.

It's **Salesforce**, which means a strong focus on data - you cannot really operate effectively on any level without a tight database underneath you, right? Right. So here it is, their solution for marketers to have a 360 degrees view of the customer, map their journey, make interactions meaningful and keep track of every step in the most transparent way.

Being **Salesforce** it also means it fully integrates with the other Clouds, consolidating that 360 degrees view of the customer idea and helping the whole organisation, not just the Marketing team, keep all interactions consistent regardless of whether the customer is still in the prospect stage, an old loyal client, or anywhere in between.
