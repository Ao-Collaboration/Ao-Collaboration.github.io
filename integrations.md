## Why choosing apps integration?

* As a business, you already rely on an array of applications that work with your business processes

* Whether you are about to start your **Salesforce** journey or you are just looking at improving your daily operations, integration is the perfect solution if you are looking at avoiding removing errors in data from duplicated entries across your platforms

* Integration is the best way to easily orchestrate your platforms to improve business processes. Implementing integrations is also a perfect time for you to review your processes and see if they can be improved - **it's often better to improve what's there than starting from scratch**

* It's also great for making sure your tech isn't making it harder to do your work

* Integrating is a huge **cost vs time** saver! Letting you and your team continue using what they are already well versed in using and making sure it sends the right information to your new or improved CRM is much more sensible than moving all operations to a single platform and updating all your existing processes
